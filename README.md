## React Hooks Test

This is a simple project to test out the basic ReactJS hooks: State, Effect and Context.
They're used in a Notes application where you can create and delete notes. Each note has a title and body.


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
